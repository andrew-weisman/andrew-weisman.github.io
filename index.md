I am a computational scientist who enjoys solving interesting and important problems, particularly those that involve working with data, deriving and solving equations, and implementing solutions in code.

Projects that interest me span from physics to biology to computational methods development. Please see below for my past projects, but keep in mind I would also be excited to dive into areas unfamiliar to me. I am a fast and efficient learner!

## [Frederick National Laboratory](https://frederick.cancer.gov/)

Data Scientist, *2018 to present*

### Selected projects

[Statistical analysis of cell interactions:](./statistical_analysis_of_cell_interactions.md) Developed a method to determine whether immune cells were interacting in multiplex immunofluorescence images of lung cancers

[Gene importance in pediatric cancers:](./gene_importance_in_pediatric_cancers.md) Developed a method to identify the genes that best discriminate between pediatric cancers using gene expression data

[3D segmentation of mitochondria:](./3d_segmentation_of_mitochondria.md) Helped develop a method to identify the mitochondria in 3D cryogenic electron microscopy scans of fibroblast cells
