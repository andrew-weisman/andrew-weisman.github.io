I am a computational scientist who enjoys tackling interesting and important problems. The more the problems involve working with data, deriving and solving equations, and implementing solutions in code, the better!

Projects that interest me span from physics to biology to computational methods development. Please see below for my past projects, but please keep in mind I would be more than happy to dive into areas unfamiliar to me. I am a fast and efficient learner!

## [Frederick National Laboratory](https://frederick.cancer.gov/)

Data Scientist, *2018 to present*

### Selected projects

[Statistical analysis of cell interactions](bleh.md) Developed a method to determine whether immune cells were interacting in multiplex immunofluorescence images of lung cancers, hinting at specific interactions between cells in longer-living patients

[Gene importance in pediatric cancers](bleh.md) Developed a method to identify the genes that best discriminate between pediatric cancers from gene expression data

[3D segmentation of mitochondria](bleh.md) Helped develop a method to identify the mitochondria in 3D cryogenic electron microscopy scans of fibroblast cells
