I am a computational scientist who enjoys tackling interesting and important problems. The more the problems involve working with data, deriving and solving equations, and implementing solutions in code, the better!

Projects that interest me span from physics to biology to computational methods development. Please see below for my past projects, but please keep in mind I would be more than happy to dive into areas unfamiliar to me; I am a fast and efficient learner!
