## Project summary

Our collaborators provided data from immunohistochemistry analysis containing the 2D spatial coordinates of various combinations of cell surface markers.

Our goal was to determine whether cell species were interacting with other species, and to what extent. We translated this question into determining whether the relative densities of cell species around other species were random.



Developed a method to determine whether immune cells were interacting in multiplex immunofluorescence images of lung cancers
